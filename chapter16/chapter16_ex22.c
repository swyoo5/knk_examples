/*
Let chess_pieces be the following enumeration :
enum chess_pieces {KING, QUEEN, ROOK, BISHOP, KNIGHT, PAWN};
(a) Write a declaration (including an initializer) for a constant array of integers named piece_value that stores the numbers 200, 9, 5, 3, 3, and 1, representing the value of each chess piece, from king to pawn.(The king's value is actually infinite, since "capturing" the king(checkmate) ends the game, but some chess-playing software assigns the king a large value such as 200.)

(b) (C99) Repeat part (a), but use a designated initializer to initialize the array. Use the enumeration constants in chess_pieces as subscripts in the designators.
*/

// (a)
const int piece_value[] = {200, 9, 5, 3, 3, 1};

// (b)
const int piece_value[] = {[KING] = 200, [QUEEN] = 9, [ROOK] = 5, [BISHOP] = 3, [KNIGHT] = 3, [PAWN] = 1};
