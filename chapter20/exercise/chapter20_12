The following function supposedly combines two bytes to form an unsigned short integer. Explain why the function doesn't work and show how to fix it.
unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
	return high_byte << 8 + low_byte;
}

산술연산자는 이동연산자보다 우선순위가 높다

unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high byte, unsigned char low_byte)
{
	return (high_byte << 8) + low_byte;
}
