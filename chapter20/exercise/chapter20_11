Each of the following macros defines the position of a single bit within an integer:
#define SHIFT_BIT 1
#define CTRL_BIT  2
#define ALT_BIT   4
The following statement is supposed to test whether any of the three bits have been set, but it never displays the specified message. Explain why the statement doesn't work and show how to fix it. Assume that key_code is an int variable.
if (key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT) == 0)
	printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");

== 연산자는 & 보다 우선순위를 가지므로 괄호를 쳐야한다.
if ((key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)) == 0)
	printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");
