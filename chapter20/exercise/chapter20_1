Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments. Assume that i, j, and k ard unsigned short variables.

(a) i = 8; j = 9;
printf("%d", i >> 1 + j >> 1);

i >> (1 + j) >> 1 = 1 >> 10 >> 1 = 0

(b) i = 1;
printf("%d", i & ~i);

1 & 0 = 0;

(c) i = 2; j = 1; k = 0;
printf("%d", ~i & j ^ k);

1

(d) i = 7; j = 8; k = 9;
printf("%d", i ^ j & k);

15
